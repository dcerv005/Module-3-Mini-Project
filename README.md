This mini-project, 'The Contact Management System,' is a tool to add, edit, delete, and search through contacts. There are different options that you can choose from. 
Options:
1. Will allow you to add a new contact. You will also be able to add a phone number, email, address, and notes to that specific contact.
2. Once you have a contact in the system you can go back and edit any part of it. If you need to change the name of the contact you simply press 2, type in 'name' and then the new name that you want it to be under. Same goes if you want to change any element of the contact information.
3. With this option you can delete any of your contacts. All you need is to type in the contact name.
4. With option 4 you can search for a specific contact. The system will display the contacts information.
5. Here you can view all the contacts that you have.
6. If you need  to export a contact into a file you will be able to do so with this option. You will have to type in, when prompted, the name of the contact and if the file is new or exsisting. If its new the option is w, and if not then a. This will help if you want to add another contact to the file instead of overwritting the file.
7. If you want to import contacts from a txt file this is the option you will need to type. Just type in the file name and it will be added to your contacts.
